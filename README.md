Student’s Name:	Mosamma Sultana Trina

Student’s Roll:	BSSE-1313

Project Description:

The goal of this project is to build Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for C Source Code. The AST will be a tree-like structure that represents the syntactic structure of the source code in a way that is easy to understand and manipulate. The Abstract Syntax Tree will include (Basic for loop, while loop, if statement).

Project Objectives:

1. Perform lexical analysis on the source code to break it down into a sequence of tokens
2. Construct a parse tree that represents the syntactic structure of the source code
3. Build the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the parse tree.


Languages or Tools to be used:
C, C++, Visual Studio Code, CodeBlocks, Git, Github
